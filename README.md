Repository for code and data relevant to our paper on companion chatbots and loneliness. 

Currently, only the relevant survey data from the first survey, used for the paper [Chatbot Companionship: A Mixed-Methods Study of Companion Chatbot Usage Patterns and Their Relationship to Loneliness in Active Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21596), is uploaded. The other data and code will be made available at a later date.
